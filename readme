# Task Management System

A role-based user management system built with Spring Boot and React, designed to manage tasks, user profiles, and administrative roles with secure authentication and authorization. The system supports three roles: `USER`, `ADMIN`, and `CEO`, each with distinct permissions for managing user data and tasks.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login/logout with session management.
- **Role-Based Access Control**:
  - **USER**: View/edit own profile, reset password, access tasks.
  - **ADMIN**: View/edit own profile, reset password, view/delete `USER` role users, access tasks.
  - **CEO**: View/edit own profile, reset password, view `USER`/`ADMIN` users (excluding own details), create/delete admins, access tasks.
- **Profile Management**: Users can update personal details (name, phone, address, etc.).
- **Admin Management**: CEO can create/delete `ADMIN` users.
- **User Bio Details**: Display user details in tables (CEO: `USER`/`ADMIN`, ADMIN: `USER` only).
- **Password Reset**: Token-based password reset with history tracking.
- **Responsive UI**: Table-based user/admin lists with responsive design using Tailwind CSS.
